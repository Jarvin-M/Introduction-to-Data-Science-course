# Introduction-to-Data-Science-course
My attempts to parts of various assignments I took in MSc Computing Science.

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [KNNClassification.ipynb](./KNNClassification.ipynb) | Testing different paramters for KNN classifier that perform best on the health data( Acute Myeloid Leukemia patients). GridSearchCV was used to combine the Kfold cross validation, the KNN parameters and the Matthew's corrcoef scorer  |
| [KNNDecisionTreesEnsemble.ipynb](./KNNDecisionTreesEnsemble.ipynb) | Training KNN, Decision Tree and SVM predictors to inform which set of parameters for each algorithm give high accuracy scores. The best predictors are selected using a voting classifier and are used to form an ensemble. The ensemble's performance is then compared to the Random Forest ensemble. The ensemble is then used to predict classes for unused test data.  |
| [NTLKTextAnalysis.ipynb](./NTLKTextAnalysis.ipynb) | Text Analysis on Gutenberg corpus using the NTLK library |
| [gaussianMixtureModels.ipynb](./gaussianMixtureModels.ipynb) | Gaussian Mixture Models on Galaxy data. We assume that the clusters are generated by k Gaussians. From this we can find the cluster cohesion and separation which in turn can show which galaxies are from very early merges and recent merges.|
| [mypca.m](./mypca.m) | Function perfroming Principal Component Analysis; which rotates the axis of a matrix and returns the eigne vlaues and principle components of data. These outputs represent the direction in which data varies and can be used in dimensionality reduction |
